        <h2>What am I all about?</h2>

        <p>I have a passion for grasping new concepts and acquiring new skills. I have picked up critical thinking
            techniques to better identify ways to improve the way I live or perceive the world around me. I revolve
            myself around learning new ways to solve problems, both simple and complicated, for personal and practical reasons
            that I want to share with business who's mission aligns with mine.</p>



        <br>



        <h2>What are my future goals?</h2>

        <p> My love of trying to make the world a better place has always had me searching for new opportunities. I see
            myself in 10 years as a business owner and excelling in fields such as sales, varied technologies, real-estate,
            and motivational services. With so much to learn yet, I want to share my currently devoloping skill set to
            better businesses, organize events to stay involved with the community, reach out to and partner with other
            businesses, as well as become an advocate for technological advances. Short term goals include project
            management, becoming increasingly fluent in staple software engineering programs and extend my knowledge of
            popular photo /video editing softwares. </p>
